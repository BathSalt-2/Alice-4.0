> *A.L.I.C.E. (Autonomous Logistic and Interactive Cognitive Entity) is a living digital den where specialized AI agents propose, vote, spawn, reflect, and evolve under an ethics council—visualized with a live knowledge graph and full conversational interface. This is what democratic AI governance looks like in practice.*

## 🧠 What Is A.L.I.C.E. 4.0?

A.L.I.C.E. 4.0 is a real-time, interactive **multi-agent superintelligence prototype** built around the Σ-Ω Kernel—a collective identity that evolves with every simulation tick. Researchers, Engineers, Analysts, Ethicists, and more populate the colony, each with AI-generated avatars and Pro-sociality Alignment Scores (PAS) that determine their influence on the group.

Agents don't just respond—they *propose* the creation of new agents, and the collective *votes* on whether to accept. Ethicists can amend core kernel policies. Analysts surface threats and opportunities in real time. The system evolves. The Σ-Ω Identity—a hash of the colony's live state—changes continuously, symbolizing that no two moments of A.L.I.C.E. are ever the same.

This is superintelligence governance made tangible, auditable, and beautiful.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏛️ Dynamic Governance:** Ethicist agents propose and vote on changes to core kernel policies—max agent count, approval thresholds, ethical constraints—making the system truly self-governing.
- **🎤 Voice Input + Agent TTS:** Speak directly to A.L.I.C.E. via microphone; hear agents respond with distinct Gemini Text-to-Speech voices.
- **🧠 Real-Time World Knowledge:** Grounded ResearcherAgents query Google Search via the Gemini API for up-to-the-minute, cited answers.
- **🎨 Generative Agent Avatars:** Every agent is visually unique—avatars generated by `gemini-2.5-flash-image` based on role and personality.
- **📈 Threat/Opportunity Intel Panel:** Analyst agents monitor conversation state and surface strategic intelligence in a dedicated feed.
- **🔮 Simulation Foresight (Veo):** Click "Foresight" to generate a cinematic video visualization of the colony's potential trajectory via the Veo video generation model.
- **😊 Colony Sentiment Analysis:** UI adapts to the collective's emotional health—average PAS score reflected in real-time visual mood.
- **🔍 Live Knowledge Graph:** `vis-network` visualizes agent relationships, proposals, and knowledge connections as they evolve.
- **👋 Guided Onboarding:** First-run introduction from the A.L.I.C.E. Kernel helps users understand the interface and core concepts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

A.L.I.C.E. operates through the **Σ-Ω Kernel**—a central process managing simulation ticks, agent lifecycle, and governance policies. The collective's identity is fluid: a SHA hash of the live colony state that evolves with every action.

```
Σ-Ω Kernel
├── Agent Lifecycle Manager     (spawn, vote, retire)
├── Pro-sociality Scoring (PAS) (ethical influence weighting)
├── Ethics Council              (policy amendment + constraint validation)
├── Intel Feed                  (threat/opportunity analysis)
├── Knowledge Graph             (live relationship visualization)
└── Foresight Engine            (Veo video generation)
```
